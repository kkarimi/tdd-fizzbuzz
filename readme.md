### FizzBuzz TDD ###

FizzBuzz is a challenge which is designed to test your programming skills.

This particular variant will assess your ability to 'test drive' the FizzBuzz module (called ```fizz-buzz.js```) using Test Driven Development (TDD).

We would like you to design a module that generates the FizzBuzz array.

### We are looking for : ###

1) Complete test coverage of each specification of FizzBuzz
2) Clean Code + Clean Tests
3) A Simple Design

### Specifications (each specification may override the preceding one) ###

- The program should allow any range of numbers to be supplied (as two arguments). The first argument is the start number and the second argument is the final number.
    - given the numbers 1,10 are supplied FizzBuzz will produce an array : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
    - given the numbers 1,100 are supplied FizzBuzz will produce an array : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (and on to 100)
    
- The program should change the array item to the word Fizz for multiples of 3
 
- The program should change the array item to Buzz for multiples of 5
 
- The program should change the array item to FizzBuzz for multiple of 3 and 5

- The program should allow the user to reverse the array and delete all FizzBuzz items
